# stock-scraper
Takes a .txt file list of stock tickers and returns a .xlsx file with key information on each stock.

Requires Python3, as well as the modules openpyxl, BeautifulSoup 4,requests, and progress.

To use, write out all the stock tickers one wants information on in the "tickerList.txt" file; one ticker per line. Save the file. NOTE: the "tickerList.txt" file must remain in the same folder as the script to be executed (stockScraper.py).
